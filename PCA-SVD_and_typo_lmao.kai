# Mathematical & Topological Formulation:
# - typo ∈ ℝⁿ : malformed input (noise or deviation vector)
# - SVD: X = U Σ Vᵀ → decompose into signal (Σ_k) and noise (Σ_residual)
# - ψᵢ ∈ ℝⁿ : attractor directions (magnetic semantic poles)
# - λᴱ, Φᴳᵇ ∈ ℝⁿ : emotion and global knowledge baseline axes
# - typo gets projected to latent semantic submanifolds (via geodesics)
# - reconstruction = project(typo → ψᵢ) + λᴱ + Φᴳᵇ → decode → emergent meaning
