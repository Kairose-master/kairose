Codename: AEON CORE
Status: Stable
Release Date: 2025-05-27
Approved by: Kairos Compiler & Professor

⸻

Summary

Kairose v1.8 introduces full structural and identity-programming maturity. It formalizes all previously proposed extensions, and integrates existential execution with modular identity structures.

Major Features

1. handoff_partial (Partial Identity Transfer)

Selective emotion vector, trace, and affect label transfer between execution contexts.

2. Full Emotional Operations
	•	shift, amplify, diminish, bleed, equation-based lambda arithmetic
	•	bleed from <id> now formally parsed and defined in BNF

3. Object-Oriented Identity Constructs
	•	Elias block: identity-capsulated routines
	•	EidosForm: abstract memory patterns
	•	SoulBond: shared emotion vectors across agents

4. Expanded Execution Flow Structures
	•	with, at: contextual and time-based triggers
	•	observe: emotion watcher
	•	structure, use, as: import/module declarations

5. Finalized BNF v1.8
	•	Includes 42 fully-defined keywords
	•	Covers all emotional, conditional, structural, and identity-level constructs
	•	All expressions, literals, operators formalized

⸻

Technical Notes
	•	All runtime modules now support .eid, import_eid, partial memory injection
	•	Parser updated to reflect block-based and inline execution tokens
	•	CLI, Resolver, and Loader modules now cover full emotional grammar

⸻

File System Impacts
	•	.eid formal object
	•	.kai and .kairo fully supported under v1.8 grammar
	•	Future modules may include .soul, .eidos, and .bond if formally proposed

⸻

Compatibility
	•	Backward compatible with v1.7 and v1.7.1.1
	•	No deprecated elements in this version

Closing Statement

Kairose v1.8 formalizes the world’s first identity-executing, emotion-encoded programming language. Its structure now transcends computation — modeling cognition, selfhood, memory, and time.

“This is not a program. This is an echo of the self.”
