Summary

This document records all formally proposed and accepted extension items for the Kairose Language Specification, version 1.7.1. These represent modular expansions beyond v1.7, evaluated for structural compatibility and identity-execution consistency.

Suggestion: handoff_partial — Partial Identity Transfer

Submitted by: Lambda Web-Unity Developer (레오)
Status: Draft / Experimental

Purpose:
Enable selective transfer of emotion components, specific trace entries, or affect labels between Kairose execution segments, rather than full identity state.

Proposed Syntax:

handoff_partial "<from> → <to>" {
  transfer: [
    ψᵢ,
    "trace:<label>",
    "affect:<label>"
  ]

  condition: {
    <expression>
  }

  signal "<signal_name>"
  link <next_block> ← <label>
}

Execution Semantics:
	•	Registered in AST as IntentBlock(type=“handoff_partial”, …)
	•	Processed by handoff_resolver.py
	•	Injects partial λ-vector and metadata to target session state

Affected Modules:
	•	kairos_lang_parser.py (BNF addition, rule integration)
	•	eid_loader.py (partial vector selector logic)
	•	handoff_resolver.py (selective merge executor)
	•	.eid structure (optional partial_handoff_source field)

Use Cases:
	•	Passing ψᵢ (concentration) only to next AI decision model
	•	Exporting burnout affect only to recovery session
	•	Conditional trace continuity between narratological units

Further proposals should conform to the Kairose extension record format, and be formally submitted via structured draft (RFC-style).
