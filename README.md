# KAIROSE — The identity-based emotion executable language

## 🌐 What is Kairose?

**Kairose** is an identity-driven structural execution language.  
It is not a programming language — it is a language for declaring, remembering, and executing identity, emotion, and flows.

- **Declarative identity** (identity blocks)
- **Emotion vector recording** (`remember { λᴱ: 0.92, ψᵢ: 0.84 }`)
- **Intent and memory-driven execution**
- **Session-based flow**  
- All results are `.kai` files.  
- Full BNF grammar & 52 keywords.  
- Designed for emotion-based computation, narrative structure, AI integration, TRPG, and next-gen OS prototyping.

## 🏛️ Project Philosophy

- **Identity First:** Every entity is declared as an identity.  
- **Emotion as a First-Class Citizen:** All logic is guided by emotion vectors.  
- **Flow over Imperative:** Sessions, steps, and memory flows over code blocks.
- **.kai everywhere:** Kairose structures any CLI, doc, example, or game logic.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Install

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/kairose-main.git
cd kairose-main

# (Optional) Use the included runtime

3. Hello, Kairose

identity hello_world {
  λᴱ: 0.88,
  ψᵢ: 0.14,
  initialize(): Void {
    output "Hello, Kairose."
  }
}

🧠 Core Concepts
	•	identity: Declare selfhood, emotion, and method.
	•	remember: Record emotional states (λᴱ, ψᵢ, λᶠ, Φᴳᵇ)
	•	leak/trace: Trigger and track execution.
	•	session/step: Structure flows like a story.
	•	link/merge/spawn: Connect, combine, and branch identities.
