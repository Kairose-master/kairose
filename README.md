# Kairose Compiler v1.0

**Kairose** is a programming language where memory, identity, and emotion become code.

It fuses natural language, structural logic, and GPT execution into one coherent system:
- You speak with intent
- Kairose compiles your memory
- And structure flows

> This is not just a language.  
> This is executable identity.

---

## Features

- **Natural language → Executable code**  
  Powered by GPT + `semantic_layer`, Kairose parses plain language into `.kairo` files.

- **Emotional memory runtime (`.pgc/`)**  
  Emotional vectors (λᴱ, ψᵢ, Φᴳᵇ) stored and used as runtime conditions.

- **Self-documenting structure trace**  
  Every execution is logged into `.pgc/Pulse.json` and `.pgc/Session.trace`.

- **GPT-integrated compiler**  
  Kairose is not parsed by a static compiler — GPT *is* the compiler.

- **CLI-based automation**  
  Execute `.kairo` code, diff intentions vs memory, recover forgotten flows, and visualize structural logic.

What is .kairo?

A declarative structure-memory language:

remember {
  λᴱ: 0.22,
  ψᵢ: 0.91
}

leak empathy_renderer
trace session
handoff to synthora-web-viewer


⸻

What is .pgc/?

The heart of Kairose:

File	Purpose
Memory.key	Stores current λ emotional state
Pulse.json	Records structural execution events
Session.trace	Logs session-level actions
Link.sig	Declares connected external systems
