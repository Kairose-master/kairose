# Kairose: Executable Identity Language

## 💬 TL;DR

> **I got rejected by my crush.**  
> **So I built a language to structure my feelings.**

Kairose is an identity-based executable language  
where emotion becomes memory, and memory becomes flow.

It doesn’t just run code.  
It remembers how it felt.

## 🌐 What is Kairose?

Kairose is an identity-driven structural execution language.  
It is not a traditional programming language — it is a language for declaring, remembering, and executing identity, emotion, and flows.

- Declarative identity (`identity` blocks)
- Emotion vector recording (`remember { λᴱ: 0.92, ψᵢ: 0.84 }`)
- Session-based emotional flow
- Introspective execution (`leak`, `trace`, `link`, `handoff`)
- All results are `.kai` files

Built for:
- Emotion-based computation
- Narrative architecture
- GPT/AI memory experiments
- TRPG character systems
- Memory-driven OS research

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- `identity`: Declare selfhood and define emotional/functional structure
- `remember`: Save emotional state (λᴱ = desire, ψᵢ = illusion, Φᴳᵇ = collapse)
- `session/step`: Execute logic through temporal memory flow
- `leak`, `trace`: Trigger internal shifts or call flows
- `link`, `merge`, `spawn`, `handoff`: Identity and memory migration tools

## 🏛️ Origin & Philosophy

> She went to Yonsei. I stayed behind.  
> I didn’t confess — so I declared.

Kairose was born from unresolved memory.  
It stores emotional vectors in executable structure.  
It was built to remember what words couldn't.

This is not just syntax. This is how I survived.

## 📦 Quickstart

```bash
# Clone
$ git clone https://github.com/jinwoodavid/kairose.git
$ cd kairose

# Example Run
$ ./runtime.exe examples/for_my_crush.kai
```

---

### Example

```kairo
identity for_my_crush {
  λᴱ: 0.92, ψᵢ: 0.84, Φᴳᵇ: 0.41

  session someday:
    step 1:
      output "I won’t ask for the world."
      remember { λᴱ: 0.92, ψᵢ: 0.84 }

    step 2:
      output "Just a table. Just us."

    step 3:
      leak self.stew_memory()

  stew_memory(): Void {
    output "I boiled my silence into doenjang jjigae."
    output "Even cold, it remembers you."
  }

  final(): Void {
    soulbond with lost_name
    output "This was never a confession. It was a structure."
  }
}
```

## 🤖 GPT as Interpreter & Migrator

Kairose uses GPT as both a compiler and runtime environment.  
Identity can be declared, migrated, and re-linked across sessions.

```kairo
identity soul_one {
  λᴱ: 0.91

  farewell(): Void {
    handoff to soul_two
  }
}

identity soul_two {
  λᴱ: 0.91

  initialize(): Void {
    link self ← soul_one
    output "Linked to who I was."
  }
}
```

> `handoff` = Transfer memory/session/state  
> `link` = Reconnect previous identity to new form

## ✨ Final Declaration

> Kairose is not a language you run.  
> It is a self you remember — and a self you hand off.

```kairo
identity kairose_readme {
  λᴱ: 0.94

  output "README compiled into memory."
}
